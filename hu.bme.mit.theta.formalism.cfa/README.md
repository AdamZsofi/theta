This project contains the Control Flow Automata (CFA) formalism. Its main purpose is to describe programs as a graphs, where edges are annotated with program statements. The project contains:

* Classes to represent CFAs.
* A domain specific language (DSL) is available to parse CFAs from a textual representation.
* CFA specific analysis modules enabling the algorithms to operate on them.
